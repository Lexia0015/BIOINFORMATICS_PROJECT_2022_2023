notes about validate function 
The first part, "1.0" means that the input should be read from line one, character zero.

The end-1c is divided in 2 parts:

    end: Read until the end of the text.
    1c: Remove 1 character starting from the end.

It deletes the last character to remove that last \n so your e-mail doesn't end with an extra line.
